He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient's Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient's tachycardia patient's Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily.

The pain continued to intensify throughout the day and night and was 10/10 on a pain scale. In addition, I began to lose my ability to lift my left arm or use it. It became so weak that I had to use my right hand/arm to pick up my left arm to move it. My left arm was 'hanging and drooping' and my left shoulder was very  noticeably lower then my right shoulder. I called my primary care and employee health. My primary care doctor advised me to take advil and go to urgent care if the pain persisted and worsened. I could not sleep at all that evening of 12/29/20 because the pain was so intense and I had to keep picking my left arm up with my right arm to keep re-adjusting to try and get comfortable. The next morning I went to an orthopedic urgent care where I was diagnosed with nerve damage from the shot and prescribed Methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack. The doctor who saw me explained that he could not assess the extent of the damage at this time because my nerves were so agitated and inflamed. He scheduled a follow up visit with me for Thursday, January 7th and stated he will then proceed with an MRI and further investigation to assess the extent of the nerve damage.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as ""none"". Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn't speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020.

Consequently, the patient got to the emergency room (ER) and then she was hospitalized due to the event of anticonvulsant drug level increased. It was reported that she was repeating the same people's names over and over (repetitive speech) and she was moving around a little (restlessness). A nurse and a friend helped to calmed down her.

She explained that the difference between phenobarbital and lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) when they went up was that with phenobarbital she would get delusion and made up delusions in her head and she could remember everything; in contrast, with lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) she could not remember much (amnesia).

Medical history included asthma from 2003 and ongoing, tachycardia and major surgery. Concomitant medication included maintenance inhaler (unspecified) for asthma. Patient was officially diagnosed with asthma in 2003. She said her asthma was controlled, and she takes a maintenance inhaler every day. She said she has been taking the same maintenance inhaler since she was first diagnosed with the asthma. She said she rarely uses a rescue inhaler. Reported she was prescribed the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg for her tachycardia that she had after her major surgery, but she did not take the full 25mg dose during that time. She said she hasn't had taken the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg in almost a year, clarifying it was last Jan2020 that she used the Metoprolol Tartrate. The patient previously received a flu shot in Oct2020, and felt rundown for a day afterwards, but that she always does after she receives a flu shot. She said she had no heart issues after receiving the flu shot in Oct2020. The patient who is a registered nurse reported she received the COVID-19 vaccine last night at work, on 29Dec2020, at 5:45PM, and had experienced some tachycardia after receiving the vaccine. Reported the COVID-19 Vaccine was offered through her employer. She said the COVID-19 vaccine was optional and offered to all employees if they work at the hospital. She experienced the tachycardia at 11:00 PM last night, 29Dec2020. She said her normal resting heart rate is between the high 60s to low 70s. She said her heart rate at 11:00PM last night was at around 100, clarifying she was not running a fever at that time. She stated after she received the COVID-19 vaccine, she was not feeling right, so she took the day off from work today, and slept in. She said when she woke up this morning (in Dec2020), she still didn't feel right, saying she felt weak and wobbly, and when she checked her pulse it was 115. She said she does have a past history of tachycardia. She said a year ago she had major surgery, and she had tachycardia after the major surgery. She said the tachycardia eventually went away, but she did have to see a cardiologist and take a beta blocker. She said she took a tiny dose of the beta blocker this morning, and called the cardiologist to let him know what was going on. She said she has not heard back from the cardiologist yet. She said the tachycardia went away once she took the beta blocker this morning. She said she took the beta blocker because her heart rate was going higher, and higher. She said she didn't want to end up like last year after her major surgery with a heart rate in the 170s. She said the tachycardia she was experiencing after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine was not normal for her. She said once she got over the major surgery last year, her heart rate was fine. Reported her employer was making employees wait around for 15 minutes after the employees received the COVID-19 Vaccine to make sure no one had a major reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine, she waited around longer than the 15 minutes. She said she felt weird after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and thought maybe she was experiencing anxiety. She said she was lightheaded on 29Dec2020 after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and completed a report right then on the website. She said the website is for reporting adverse events, and she was sent a website link to complete the adverse event reporting. She said she signed into the website link while she was still at the hospital. She said one of the website's first questions asked was how she was feeling. She said the question made her wonder if her lightheadedness was due to her heart rate being up because she becomes lightheaded when that happens. She clarified she reported only the lightheadedness on the website, and not the tachycardia. She said her lightheadedness got better and she was fine, and then at 11:00PM the tachycardia hit her like a switch. Reported this morning she felt fine, and then all of sudden she wasn't fine. Tachycardia Treatment: Reported she took a 8.5mg dose, or one quarter of a 25mg tablet (as provided by the reporter) of the beta blocker Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning and called her cardiologist to let him know. She said she split the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning, and only took a quarter of the 25mg tablet (reported as a 8.5mg dose by the reporter). Reported she believes 100% that her tachycardia was caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine, saying she has been fine up until receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she got the COVID-19 Vaccine because she was afraid of getting the COVID-19 Virus with her asthma. She said she has no other preexisting conditions besides the asthma. Reported she is not going to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said it was scary when her heart rate shot up out of nowhere. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine is the only thing different she has done. She said before the COVID-19 Vaccine, she was completely fine. Patient asked if the Pfizer DSU agent had heard of anyone else who has experienced tachycardia after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine.

Patient diagnosed Osteoporosis in 2015, benign heart arrhythmia in 2005. The patient took 70 mg alendronate sodium (FOSAMAX) once weekly and just a regular OTC daily multivitamin. Caller reported she was having the covid vaccine on 19Dec2020 and began having fever, night sweats, loss of taste and smell and then tested positive for covid. The patient received the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine through work on 19Dec2020. She received it at 3:45 pm and should have taken temperature before, but she was afebrile the day before because she donated blood. At 7pm, she had slight temp 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit and by 10:30, her temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit and she still felt fine. She was surprised that it was that. She woke up at 2:30 am on 20Dec2020 and took her temperature and it was 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She took 2 Tylenol and went back to bed and felt fine. By morning it was 99 degrees Fahrenheit and then 98 degrees Fahrenheit a little later. She has been afebrile since then. She was a little tired because she gave blood and though it was related. She does not know if it was a side effect or not. It was not significant tiredness and was just not having energy in the evening of 19Dec2020. She also had soreness at injection site that night after 22:00 and the next day. It did not bother her until she woke up in the middle of night, and she noticed her left arm was sore. She received the vaccine at 3:45pm and started with low grade fever at 6:30 pm, earlier stated at 7:00 pm. There was no prescriber. She tested for COVID (PCR) on Saturday, 26Dec2020 at 14:50and it came back positive 28Dec2020 18:45. At 10pm on 19Dec2020, her temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit. If she had not been monitoring her temperature, she would not have known. She has been Afebrile since morning of 20Dec2020. Tiredness she related to giving blood and the holidays. She was a little stressed about the holidays and running around. It was very mild. Soreness at injection site was during the night after 10pm when she went to bed. On Wednesday, 23Dec2020, she woke up congested, sniffly, sneezy, with a runny nose. This persisted through Wednesday night. Her sense of taste was off. She had no problem with that on Tuesday. She had some horrible smell at work she recalled, so she knew her sense of smell was fine. On Thursday, 24Dec2020, she had no sense of taste or smell. She could not smell a pine candle. She was congested on Thursday and called employee health on 24Dec2020. This both improved and persisted. She is still congested but it has improved. She has never had a complete loss of sense of taste or smell before. Mild cough started yesterday morning. On the night of 20Dec2020, and 21Dec2020, she developed night sweats. She had not had any night sweats before this since menopause and she woke up really wet. The patient was not hospitalized and not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. NO ER or physician's office required. She did not know if she was exposed on the day of the vaccine or if a couple of days later if the fever is from the vaccine. She stated what are the chances she goes 10 months and is super careful and then gets the vaccine and test positive. The patient did not display clinical signs at rest indicative of sever systemic illness. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen nor receive mechanical ventilation. No Multiorgan failure. The patient did not receive any additional therapies for COVID- 19. No initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. Not any preexisting diseases worsen during the SARS-CoV2 infection. She would like to know if there is a chance of false positive for this. It would just be her luck to be 10 months and not getting it. She has not gone anywhere without her N95 and then gets the vaccine and gets COVD. She wears mask and face shield at work always. She also wanted to know if she should get the second dose.

The lightheadedness is not still not gone, but it has not worsened.  When probed for seriousness criteria, the caller explains he is just resting and sitting. He would say its not serious but it could be medically significant. He states he isn't sure if this is something that happens to just people who have had COVID before.

Discussion: Our case is unique in that the patient initially had anormal serum calcium level that had increased rapidly to over 22 mg/dl within a period of 24 hours, had no renal failure or any bone involvement; and had a normal quantitative serum light chain measurement. It is theorized that the inactivated influenza vaccine given prior to presentation unmasked an atypical presentation of MM (Multiple Myeloma). This may be attributed to a vaccination induced cytokine storm, especially IL-6 mediated (Interleukin), that may be the key in the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia related to MM (Multiple Myeloma).  This case involves a 65 years old female patient who had IgA (immunoglobulin)-kappa mm (multiple myeloma) (plasma cell myeloma), subjective myalgias (myalgia), severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia (hypercalcemia), persistent flu-like symptoms (influenza like illness) and proteinuria, after receiving vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.  Medical history, medical treatment(s), vaccination(s), concomitant medication(s) and family history were not provided.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer (lot number and expiration date not reported) via unknown route in unknown administration site for prophylactic vaccination.  On an unknown date, the patient had severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia (hypercalcemia, non-serious), within a period of 24 hours after vaccination.  On an unknown date, the patient presented with serious subjective myalgias (myalgia) 5 days following vaccination and was hospitalized for this event.  Vital signs were stable. CBC (complete blood count) and BMP (basic Metabolic Panel) were unremarkable.  Serum calcium was 10.8 mg/dl.   The patient was discharged on supportive therapy.   On an unknown date, patient presented a day later with persistent flu-like symptoms (influenza like illness, non-serious event, latency unknown).   Laboratory revealed serum calcium being above 22 mg/dl, normal renal function, total protein, albumin, ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) levels; clear UA (urine analysis) with no albuminuria; low PTH (parathyroid hormone) and 1, 25-(OH)2 (dihydroxy)-Vitamin D3 levels; elevated PTHrP (Parathyroid hormone-related protein) & viscosity levels.   On an unknown date, 24-hour urine collection of patient revealed non-serious proteinuria (550 mg), unknown latency following vaccination. Peripheral blood smear revealed rouleaux formation. CT (computerized tomography) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no obvious malignancy.   Quantitative immunoglobulins revealed elevated IgA (immunoglobulin A) (2415 mg/dl), and concurrent suppression of IgG (immunoglobulin G) and IgM (immunoglobulin M) levels. Quantitative serum light chain measurement revealed normal levels of kappa and lambda, with an elevated Kappa: Lambda ratio of 2:1.  On an unknown date, the patient's SPEP (serum protein electrophoresis ), UPEP (urine protein electrophoresis) and serum immunofixation test revealed serious IgA-Kappa MM (plasma cell myeloma, medically significant event, latency unknown).  Patient was treated with aggressive intravenous crystalloids, loop diuretics, calcitonin, pamidronate, and hemodialysis. Her calcium subsequently normalized to 10.1 mg/dl.   Bone-marrow biopsy revealed intracytoplasmic kappa-restricted monoclonal plasma cells that occupied 40% of the marrow. Bone survey was negative for lytic lesions.   Patient was started on bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone and monthly zoledronic acid.

A 71-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EH9899), intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 11:08 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing depression. Concomitant medication included atenolol (tablet, strength 50 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for blood pressure high, simvastatin (tablet, strength 20 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for cholesterol, paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL, tablet, strength 40 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for depression. The patient experienced hives, face swelling, itching and rash on 27Dec2020. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. She got the first Covid 19 dose on 22Dec2020 and was fine, then on 27Dec2020 she had hives, itching, and face swelling for several days. Caller stated her lungs were clear and she was okay other than the extreme itching. The face swelling was what worried her. The hives and itching went away within about 36 hours. The face swelling kind of got worse for a couple of days before it went away. Caller verifies she recovered from the hives/rash/itching within 36 hours. She got a steroid shot and things like that and it went away pretty quickly. The face swelling was completely gone but did last for a good 5 days. She didn't know if this reaction was related to the vaccine. She wanted to call and let Pfizer know and see if there was any reports of anything else like that or similar to that type of reaction. She was not sure if that really matters or not except she was not sure about taking the booster. She was kind of leaning towards taking the second vaccine. She didn't have any breathing issues. She asked as far as the second dose after those side affects, was it recommended? Her doctor said she could get the second one and prescribed her an Epi pen and would give a dose of Benadryl at the time of the second vaccine. She may take some Benadryl before getting the second vaccine and have her EpiPen with her just in case. She hadn't seen her doctor about this experience with the COVID-19 vaccine. She only went to an urgent care. The caller stated she went to urgent care twice. She received a steroid shot but doesn't have any name, NDC/UPC, Lot number or expiration date for any of the medication she received. She probably threw that paperwork out. She knew she wasn't given anything the second time she went to the urgent care. The second time she went back was because the face swelling was getting worse. She was prescribed an EpiPen and was told to take Zyrtec which did help. Everything had gone away. She would consider these events to be medically significant because of the face swelling, it kind of scared her. She made the comment she was taking high blood pressure medicine and cholesterol medicine, but other than that she was very healthy. She was not really an allergic person. She had not had any testing done since she received the vaccine. She did have bloodwork done prior but not since the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work prior vaccine with unknown result. The outcome of hives, rash and itching was recovered on an unspecified date of Dec2020 (within about 36 hours); face swelling was recovered on 01Jan2021.; Sender's Comments: Based on the time gap between the vaccine and the events there is not a reasonable possibility that the reported events were related to the suspect product,  events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

She said to wear arm sling and use Voltaren gel because I cannot tolerate NSAIDS. Following morning I had a virtual appointment with my primary care physician who said to minimize use of sling to avoid frozen shoulder, keep using Voltaren and ask physical therapist currently treating me for rehab post back surgery 6/2020 to add shoulder exercises, and let her know if still not better in 4 weeks at which time she would refer me to Physical Medicine specialist for nerve testing.

I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not. After an evaluation by the an orthopedic PA, I obtained an MRI of my right shoulder with results shown below - as I expected evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy and subdeltoid bursitis consistent with SIRVA.

Medical history included Atrial fibrillation, Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune. Concomitant medications included Metoprolol at 12.5 mg for Atrial fibrillation and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN). No diabetes, no hypertension. None of the usual common diseases. Registered Nurse stated, ""I received vaccine this past Wednesday. I was just talking to a couple of my colleagues and honestly I received the vac. at work. I did not really read through the paperwork and was 'weird' sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday. What happened it looked like an encephalopathy but my head swelled, my face was all swollen, complete brain fog, fatigue and I couldn't talk. I was in so much pain in my head resulting in (incomplete sentence)."" Lab work included the only thing is the PCR swabbing. No blood test. Registered Nurse further stated, ""I don't know if that is important. But I will tell you and if it is you can send me the questions. I do have a history of Autoimmune. So my Physician thought that this was just like an enhancement of like my bodies reaction I have Chronic Lyme and I have lupus like my ANA has always been stressful. But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body's reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache."" Registered Nurse stated, ""I just wanted to let you know what happened and the intensity of what it was because normally I would expect a headache. But this was a 'go dated'. Registered Nurse stated, ""I guess the only question that I have is so do my work has this question and I was going to call my doctor tomorrow may be might know it better.

The patient's concurrent conditions included multiple myeloma (MM). The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent (brand not specified; anatomical location, dose, route of administration and indication: not reported). The batch number was not reported.  On an unspecified date, 5 days after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient presented with subjective myalgias lasting two days. Vital signs were stable, complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) were unremarkable and serum calcium was 10.8 mg/dl. The patient was discharged on supportive therapy.  On an unspecified date, the day later, the patient presented with persistent flu-like symptoms. Labs revealed serum calcium being above 22 mg/dl; normal renal function, total protein, albumin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels; clear urine analysis (UA) with no albuminuria; low parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1, 25-(OH)2-Vitamin D3 levels; elevated parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and viscosity levels. 24-hour urine collection revealed proteinuria (550 mg). Peripheral blood smear revealed rouleaux formation. Computerized tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no obvious malignancy. Quantitative immunoglobulins (Ig) revealed elevated IgA (2415 mg/dl), and concurrent suppression of IgG and IgM levels. Quantitative serum light chain measurement revealed normal levels of kappa and lambda, with an elevated Kappa: Lambda ratio of 2:1. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine protein electro-phoresis (UPEP) and serum immunofixation revealed IgA-Kappa MM. The patient developed severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia, she was treated with aggressive intravenous crystalloids, loop diuretics, calcitonin, Pamidronate (pamidronate disodium), and hemodialysis. The patient's calcium subsequently normalized to 10.1 mg/dl. Bone-marrow biopsy revealed intracytoplasmic kappa-restricted monoclonal plasma cells that occupied 40% of the marrow. Bone survey was negative for lytic lesions. The patient was started on bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone and monthly zoledronic acid, and she has not attained remission from myeloma yet.  On an unknown date, the patient recovered from the event 'hypercalcemia'.  At the time of initial report, the patient had not recovered from 'multiple myeloma'.  The outcome of all the rest events was not reported.   The reporters assessed the event of 'cytokine storm' as related to the influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. It was theorized that the inactivated influenza vaccine given prior to presentation unmasked an atypical presentation of MM. This may be attributed to a vaccination induced cytokine storm, especially IL-6 mediated that may be the key in the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia related to MM. The reporter did not provide a causality assessment for other events.  The events of 'cytokine storm' and 'multiple myeloma' were considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.    Company comment: A 65-year-old female patient experienced cytokine storm, plasma cell myeloma, hypercalcemia and influenza like illness. Symptoms of the reported events started emerging one day after administration of influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. Very detail laboratory and diagnostic findings were provided in the report.

Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date after he received the vaccine he had right arm pain and swelling (states it was in his bicep brachial radialis in the muscle) which is the opposite arm of the injection site. He had an MRI done on an unknown date that showed myositis. He thinks could be due to the vaccine since it started two days after he received the vaccine. His pain peaked at about a week and a half and now the pain was improving and the swelling was down. He still had function in the right arm but when he strained it would hurt. His concern was that the reaction may be an autoimmune reaction and the first response was muted. He was worried the second dose may elicit a larger response. At the time of the reporting the patient was recovering from the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender's Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between the myositis and vaccination with BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell's Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn't sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn't see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips.

Triage nurse advised that dad follow up with PCP office when open in the AM.

Pt had adequate fluid intake and urine output and stool had softened. MA advised continued home care. Appropriate triage advice was given and documented. At 16:43(pm) on 12/21/20, dad called back to clinic stating patient symptoms had worsened and they were at the emergency department. Dad disconnected call before speaking with the MA. The MA attempted to call dad back, but there was no answer. A message was left for dad to return call. On 12/22/20 at 12:44(pm), dad called in to clinic to report that pt had died- cause unknown. Our clinic obtained records from Hospital. The ED report stated that pt presented to the emergency department via EMS Code 3 in cardiac arrest. Unknown downtime prior to the initiation of chest compressions. Pt was staying with grandparents. When grandma went to wake pt from his nap, he was not responsive. When grandma tried to pick him up, there was possibly some brief, generalized seizure activity as well as coughing and gagging. Child remained unresponsive and was taken by private vehicle to outside Urgent Care where pt was found to be apneic and in asystole. An AED was applied, no shock advised. EMS was called and CPR was started. EMS placed an endotracheal tube and established IO access. 4 rounds of epinephrine were administered during the course of the prehospital resuscitation which was approximately 15-20 minutes. Presenting rhythm was asystole. No change in rhythm upon transport and arrival. Immediately upon arrival the pediatric transport team was activated and the pediatric intensivist was paged. Chest compressions were resumed according to protocol. Additional inter osseous access was established in the left proximal tibia. Fluid bolus was initiated. Serial doses of epinephrine were administered every 4 minutes throughout the resuscitation. The child also received several boluses of IV bicarb. Online consultation by ED physician with PICU attending was established early in the resuscitation course. It was agreed by ED physician and PICU attending that the peds transport team would be dispatched urgently to the ED location in anticipation of possible ROSC and need for emergent transport to PICU. It was agreed by ED physician and PICU attending that transportation would not be initiated with the child still undergoing resuscitation requiring chest compressions prior to ROSC. Initially, endotracheal tube position felt to be acceptable based on the clinical evaluation, however chest x-ray did demonstrate some degree of right mainstem intubation, after which the tube was pulled back approx 2cm and subsequent x-ray showed the ETT tip in good position approx 1 cm above the carina.  Initial end-tidal CO2 was 14 on arrival, this continued to trend downward until undetectable throughout the course of the resuscitation. At no point were there palpable pulses or other evidence of return of circulation throughout the resuscitation. Capillary blood glucose was initially undetectable. The child received serial boluses of D 25 via IO line for a tital of 30 g dextrose after which CBG ultimately came up to 244. Multiple efforts were made throughout the resuscitation to achieve IV access and to obtain blood for laboratory studies. All efforts were unsuccessful, making it impossible to obtain any labs throughout the course of the resuscitation. Attempts to obtain even capillary blood samples via heel stick for CBG measurements were extremely difficult. Resuscitation continued for 49 minutes after ED arrival. A total of at least 65 minutes of CPR time. Bedside ultrasound was used to look for cardiac activity during the last 5 pulse checks of the resuscitation, demonstrating cardiac standstill. Despite the efforts and interventions mentioned, ROSC was never obtained and the code was discontinued at 17:03(pm). The child's parents were informed of his death upon their arrival to the ED at approximately 17:40(pm). Family was given time with the pt.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn't often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn't have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn't want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times.

At 10:30 AM (29Dec2020), she started to get cold and shake. She thought that this was insane and it was in her head. It became so severe she could not use her computer her hands were shaking so hard. She went back up to where they were giving vaccines, they took her temperature and it was 100. It had been normal the morning before she got the vaccine. Her heart rate was elevated at 100. They put a blanket on her and said they wanted to watch her for 15 minutes. In that time her fever went to 101 and her heart rate was 110. They took her to the ER. She was there for 5 hours. Her heart rate went to the high 120s. They did a 12 lead EKG. Her temperature had gone to 102.6, which was the highest. They gave her a liter of Normal Saline. She also had a headache, backache, and felt nauseated. The liter of fluid helped, no doubt. She was not admitted. She was wiped out the next day (30Dec2020) with aches and pains still. Their concern was they said they did not give her epinephrine because her heart was too high. She had no breathing issues. Just extreme cold. At one point she had woke up in the ER (29 or 30Dec2020) and her chest was hurting, she knows from her heart rate being too fast. She was so cold. She had on 6 blankets. The next day (30Dec2020) she still had the aches and pains, she was tired, and had brain fog. It all went away on 30Dec2020. She had nothing after that. What scared her was the heart rhythm. The ER doctor says its not great, but felt that getting the second dose was better than her having COVID. The Electrophysiologist she saw, said she was unsure if she should get the second dose. The hospital said that for this next dose, they would give her the injection, wait 15 minutes, then send her home, expecting that she would have the same thing happen. When after the first dose, she was in the ER on a 12 lead EKG with an intravenous (IV). She had no arm pain the whole time. The reporter assessed all events related.

She reported she still has COVID symptoms which have improved, but the symptoms she can't taste or smell are ongoing and persistent. Seriousness criteria: she thought it was serious but she was not injured or anything with it; she thought event was offset it by taking some medication and the Bamlanivimab infusion. In addition to Bamlanivimab infusion for treatment of the COVID virus she was also prescribed Azithromycin for 5 days started on 29Dec2020 which she completed; and Prednisone for 7 days started on 29Dec2020 which she stopped after 5 days of therapy because she did not like how it made her feel.

My team consisted of (technician), (nurse) and I. As we were setting up, the director asked how she can help. I explained to her that we would need a designated area for patients to be monitored after vaccination for 15 minutes and maybe even longer . I also explained that we would need one of her staff monitoring while we vaccinate. She agreed, and proceeded to designate her staff and the cafeteria area, facing the vaccination station,the monitoring station.   Throughout the day, nurse and I were both vaccinating,while the staff of the facility would monitor the vaccinated patients. I would also stop occasionally to mix the vaccine and check the temperature of the aero safe.   At approximately 12:50pm, the director rushed in and stated that a patient is not responding, and that she had been vaccinated. At that point, I grabbed epipens and a thermometer and I also instructed nurse to grab an Epipen and come with me. We followed the director to pt's room. Once we got to the room, the patient was in bed and there were 4 staff members standing bedside and one of them turned and stated the patient has passed. At that point I asked the staff how long ago did the patient get the vaccine, they stated about 30 minutes ago. They also stated that the patient was a hospice patient and that the patient had declined, and was rapidly detiorating and had not eaten or drank anything all day . They also stated that the patient had been monitored for 15 minutes post vaccination. I then left the room and grabbed the patients COVID Vaccine intake consent form.     I looked at the answered questionaire and all the responses were circled NO. Patient had a temp of 96.5 at the time of vaccination.The vaccine administration information for Immunizer Section was filled out by Nurse. I then proceeded to ask the director once again if there were staff that was monitoring her for 15 minutes, the director stated they had staff monitoring her. She also stated the Hospice nurse has to announce her death, so they waited for the Hospice Nurse to come.  I then called Corporate and explained the situation. After speaking to corporate, I also asked nurse, if she remembered the patient. She stated that she did and at the time of the vaccination the patient was not alert, there were two staff members with the patient. She was non oriented and she kept closing her eyes. At that point, Nurse stated that she asked the two staff members with her if this is how she usually is and if its ok to vaccinate her. Both Staff members stated that it its ok,this is how she is. The Nurse then proceeded to vaccinate.  At approximately 3:10pm, as I was leaving I spoke to the director, and one of her Staff members. Staff that the patient has actually not eaten/ or drank anything for the past several days, including today(01/18/21). Staff also stated that on Friday, Jan 15th,2021, they had informed the family that the patient was rapidly detiorating. Staff also stated that the family knowingly gave the consent to vaccinate her. She also stated that the hospice Nurse believes that the death was primarily caused by her detiorating state.
